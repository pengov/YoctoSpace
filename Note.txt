If you create a server/part without any error being generated/displayed and 
no other computer can connect to it then make sure that the YoctoSpace application 
is allowed to communicate through the Windows Defender Firewall.

To do this, go to "Firewall and network protection" 
and then "Allow an application via the firewall". 
Look for the application in the list and if it is disabled then reactivated there. 

To do this procedure you will need administrator access to the machine.
